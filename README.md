# Multi-Sensor Environmental Monitor

## Project Overview
The Multi-Sensor Environmental Monitor is a portable system designed to measure and display environmental parameters in real-time. Using an STM32 Nucleo L476RG microcontroller, the device integrates multiple sensors and a LCD to provide a user-friendly dashboard for data visualization. The system monitors temperature, humidity, pressure, light intensity, air quality, and magnetic field strength, making it suitable for a variety of applications, including environmental monitoring, smart homes, and IoT systems.
